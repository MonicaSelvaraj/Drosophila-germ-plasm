    "Structured illumination microscopy was used to obtain z-stacks of vasaGFP and oskGFP polar granules in the germ plasm of Drosophila embryos. Each z-slice is a 16 bit grayscale image. The z-stack is like a three dimensional matrix of scalar intensity values ranging from 0-65535. Using the gray level stack histogram, Yen thresholding was applied to the z-stack to eliminate background fluorescence. The thresholded stack is like a binary three dimensional matrix in which entries of zero represent background and 1(or 65535) represents foreground. The location of high fluorescent intensity regions, i.e. foreground, was extracted from the sparse binary matrix. Row number, column number and z-slice number of high fluorescent intensity regions,  scaled to reflect biological size, was used as x, y, and z dimensional data respectively. In this way the binary sparse matrix is converted to a 3D point cloud. The conversion of the z-stack to a 3D point cloud is convenient for further computational analysis as it removes the need to manipulate large three dimensional matrices and allows us to consider only regions of fluorescence within the matrix. \n",

    "While the goal of supervised machine learning is to learn the function that was used to assign labels to a dataset so that new data can be categorized accurately, unsupervised machine learning tries to assign labels to data given no a-priori knowledge about the categories to which they belong. Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning task, which can be formulated as an optimization problem. Variability of a cluster, V, and dissimilarity  of the set of clusters obtained, D, are the metrics of the optimization problem.\n",

    "KMeans and Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering are two common clustering algorithms based on these metrics. The drawbacks of these algorithms are that they can only be applied when we expect clusters to be globular and we know the number of clusters beforehand. Density based clustering algorithms, designed to cluster regions of high density separated by regions of low density, are well suited for clustering point clouds with no prior knowledge of the number or  shape of clusters. Density based clustering is best suited to identify individual germ granules in wild type and aged Drosophila embryos since we have little a-priori knowledge about the number, size and morphology of these granules.

    "- Transform the space according to the density/sparsity.\n",
    "- Build the minimum spanning tree of the distance weighted graph.\n",
    "- Construct a cluster hierarchy of connected components.\n",
    "- Condense the cluster hierarchy based on minimum cluster size.\n",

    "It is a way of reducing the computational complexity but ensuring all points are connected. \n",

    "\n",
    "Consider having a threshold value that is initially high and is lowered\n",
    "as we drop edges we will start to disconnect the graph into connected componenets - and evetually we will have a hierarchy of connected components at varying threshold levels/ corresponding to various epsilons \n",
